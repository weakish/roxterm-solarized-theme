[Solarized] themes (dark and light) for roxterm.

[Solarized]: http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized

---------

Copy solarized-dark and/or solarized-light into 
`~/.config/roxterm.sourceforge.net/Colours/`.

Issue tracking
--------------

This repo does not have a separate issue tracking system.
Please report issue to [solarized main repo][main-its].
(You may mention me '@weakish' when reporting an issue.)

[main-its]: https://github.com/altercation/solarized/issues

Please don't use the comment form of this gist for issues/bugs/suggests
and pull requests.
(Using it for other general feedback is fine, though.)


Development
-----------

For ease of updating and to avoid manual typos,
I wrote a srcipt (gen-theme.rc) to generate the dark theme file from 
upstream (main solarized repo) README.md automatically.
Then I copied the dark theme file and edited it manually to
produce the light theme file.
(Since there are only few differences, I don't bother to alter
my script to generate both themes.
Improvements are always welcome, though.)

I preferred that you fork/clone [this repo][repo] and send me a pull request (opening up an [issue][main-its] and mention me '@weakish').

Alternatively, you can post your patch in the [issue system][main-its] directly.
